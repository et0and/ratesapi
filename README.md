This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Cloudlfare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

Cloudflare Workers is a JavaScript edge runtime on Cloudflare CDN.

You can develop the application locally and publish it with a few commands using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).
Wrangler includes a transcompiler, so we can write directly in TypeScript.

First, create your worker via the Cloudflare dashboard by following these steps:

- Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
